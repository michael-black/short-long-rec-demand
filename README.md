# Replicate Black and Woodward (Working Paper, 2020): The value of long and short term changes in water quality

This repository allows users to reproduce the results of Black and Woodward (Working Paper, 2020). Working paper available upon request; please direct working paper requests to [black.michael@tamu.edu](mailto:black.michael@tamu.edu). In the working paper, we estimate a demand model of recreation as a function of water quality that varies over time, *and* water quality that varies only over space.

Please note this repo does not contain any data. Data are available upon request; please direct data requests to [black.michael@tamu.edu](mailto:black.michael@tamu.edu).

Conditional on receiving the data files, every table and figure can be replicated.
